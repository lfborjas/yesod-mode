# Yesod Mode

Simple emacs syntax highlighting for Yesod routes and models.

## Prior Art

* Rebecca Skinner's [persistent-mode](https://github.com/rebeccaskinner/persistent-mode-el)
* [`yesod-routes.vim`](https://github.com/5outh/yesod-routes.vim) 

## Future Work

Hamlet and friends are not supported yet, mostly because I'm extremely new to Yesod.
Feel free to add a PR!
